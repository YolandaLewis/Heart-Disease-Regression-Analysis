# Heart-Disease-Regression-Analysis
This project was completed as apart of a team project to build a model for predicting cholesterol levels for heart disease patients.

The data was taken from kaggle and and includes a sample set of patients from Framingham, Massachusetts. This dataset included 4,240 patient records with 16 variables. The variables in the dataset describe several risk factors such as age, sex, hypention status, and cholesterol levels that lead to a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease.

The goal of this project was to build a model using multiple regression which could aid in diagnosing patients with heart disease faster. I wanted to know if cholesterol levels could be predicted in a patient with heart disease risk factors. More specifically, I focused on whether the presence or absence of hypertension data in patient records played a role in the predictability of total cholesterol (a risk factor for CVD) and a diagnosis of CHD.

Based on the project findings, the presence or absence of hypertension data did not increase or decrease the predictability of patient cholesterol levels. It was discovered that variables such as sex and age where more effective at predicting patient cholesterol levels.
